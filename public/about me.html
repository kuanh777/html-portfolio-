<h1>About me</h1>
<p>A 35-year-old Leo. 35 years old, and I adore animals, especially dogs. I love traveling, reading, and cooking, but nothing makes me happier than hanging out with my furry friend. </p>

<p>
    I speak English, Taiwanese, Japanese, Chinese, and French, and I'm working on passing the DELF B2 exam. When I'm not studying, I enjoy reading and cooking!
